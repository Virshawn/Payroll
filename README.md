Hey there,

I'm quite new to Github.

This is a simple Payroll app that you can run through terminal or your favorite IDE. Just compile this bad-boy and test it out.

Of course you will need to change the line of code below to incorporate your username.

    reportFile = fopen("/Users/username/Desktop/A5File.txt", "wt");
